# Configure SSL and Custom Domain for Your Website

---

### üåê Add a Custom Domain

- Buy a domain from any provider (e.g., GoDaddy, Hostinger, Namecheap).
- Create an **A Record** pointing to your AWS EC2 public IP in your DNS provider's dashboard.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Update `nginx.conf` for Your Custom Domain

- Navigate to the Nginx config file:

  ```bash
  cd /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
  ```

- Modify the file with the following configuration:

  ```nginx
  events {
  }

  http {
      server {
          listen 80;
          server_name mywebsite.com www.mywebsite.com;

          root /usr/share/nginx/path-to-your-website;
          index index.html;

          error_page 404 /404.html;

          location / {
              try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
          }

          access_log /var/log/nginx/mywebsite.com.access.log;
          error_log /var/log/nginx/mywebsite.com.error.log;
      }
  }
  ```

- Replace `mywebsite.com` and `path-to-your-website` with your actual domain and path.

- Save the changes, test your configuration:

  ```bash
  sudo nginx -t
  ```

- Then restart Nginx:

  ```bash
  sudo systemctl restart nginx
  ```

- For nodejs or nextjs app

    ```bash
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;  # Your Node.js server
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
    }
    ```

‚úÖ Once your DNS is propagated, you should be able to access your website via your custom domain over HTTP.
